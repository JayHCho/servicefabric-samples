# Azure Service Fabric Samples [**PREVIEW Branch**]

This branch contains version of the Service Fabric samples that have been updated to work with the latest private preview release of the Service Fabric SDK. If you are using the public SDK (linked from http://aka.ms/servicefabricsdk), please use the master branch. 

## How the samples are organized

The repo is divided into Actor samples and Services samples, corresponding to the two programming models available for Service Fabric, the Reliable Actors API and the Reliable Services API. You may want to read up on [how the two models compare][2] before diving in.
